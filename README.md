I am a Vanier Scholar pursuing a PhD in Statistics at the University of British Columbia under the supervision of Dr. Alexandre Bouchard-CÃ´tÃ© and Dr. Trevor Campbell. My research interests include scalable Bayesian inference and machine learning. I am passionate about using data science to solve meaningful real-world problems.

I am also a core contributor and founding member of the Pigeons software project (https://pigeons.run/). If you have a difficult sampling or integration problem, leave me a message and/or check out our software!

I was previously a co-chair and founding member of the Student Committee of the Western North American Region of the International Biometric Society. I previously held an Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (Masterâ€™s level) of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and was a recipient of the Governor Generalâ€™s Silver Medal.
